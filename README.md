   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/animerchstore.git
   cd animerchstore

   ```

2. npm install

# or

yarn install

### Start the development server

1. npm run dev

yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.




## 🧱 Technical Documentation

### 📌 Architectural Decisions

Animerch is an anime merchandise e-commerce platform built with modern web technologies, focusing on performance, simplicity, and developer experience.

- **Frontend**: [Next.js (App Router)] – for routing, performance, and SEO benefits.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS – for utility-first and consistent design system.
- **State Management**: React Context – to manage cart and auth state globally.
- **Data Source**: Local JSON file – used for storing and serving product/shop data during development.
- **Image Handling**: Static local assets – product images are served from the public directory.
- **Deployment**: Vercel – for seamless CI/CD and SSR support.

### ⚖️ Trade-offs Made

| Decision | Trade-off |
|---------|-----------|
| Used **Context API** over Redux or Zustand | Simpler setup but less scalable for large state logic |
| **Static JSON data** instead of a database | Simple and fast to set up, but limits scalability and dynamic updates. Most data is static, so real-time updates or dynamic content are not supported. |
| **SNext.js App Router (Server Components)** instead of Page Router | Provides better performance and SEO benefits, but requires adapting to new patterns and may have a learning curve. |
| No real authentication logic | Fast prototyping, but lacks real security/session handling |
| Static image hosting | Simple and fast, but not suitable for user uploads |
| No server-side business logic | Lightweight, but lacks real-time interaction or admin tools |

### 🚀 Potential Improvements

- 🔐 **Implement real authentication**:
  - Use JWT, OAuth, or Firebase Auth to handle secure user authentication and session management.
  - Add features like user registration, login, and role-based access control.

- 🔄 **Replace JSON with a proper backend and database**:
  - Use a backend framework like Node.js or Django and a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Supabase.
  - This will allow for dynamic content updates, scalability, and real-time interactions.

- 📦 **Add server-side business logic**:
  - Implement server-side validation, admin tools, and APIs for managing products, orders, and users.
  - This will improve security and enable real-time features.

- 🖼️ **Upgrade image hosting**:
  - Use a cloud-based image hosting service like Cloudinary or AWS S3 to support user-generated content and dynamic image uploads.

- 📊 **Improve state management**:
  - Consider using Redux or Zustand for more scalable and maintainable state management, especially if the app grows in complexity.

- 🚀 **Optimize performance**:
  - Use server-side rendering (SSR) or incremental static regeneration (ISR) for better performance and SEO.
  - Implement lazy loading for images and components to improve page load times.

- 🧪 **Add testing**:
  - Write unit tests for components and integration tests for critical flows (e.g., adding to cart, checkout).
  - Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

- 📱 **Enhance responsive design**:
  - Ensure the app is fully optimized for mobile devices with better responsive layouts and touch-friendly interactions.

- 🔍 **Improve search functionality**:
  - Add fuzzy search or autocomplete features to enhance the search experience.

- 📈 **Analytics and monitoring**:
  - Integrate tools like Google Analytics or Sentry to monitor user behavior and track errors in production.

- 🔄 **Proper handling of async data fetching**:
  - Use Server Components in the Next.js App Router to fetch data directly on the server for better performance and SEO.
  - Implement data fetching hooks like `useSWR` or `React Query` for client-side fetching, caching, and revalidation.

- 🌐 **SEO optimization**:
  - Add dynamic metadata (e.g., title, description, Open Graph tags) for each page using the `next/head` component or the new `metadata` API in the App Router.
  - Implement structured data (e.g., JSON-LD) for products, reviews, and breadcrumbs to improve search engine visibility.
  - Generate a sitemap and `robots.txt` file using tools like `next-sitemap` to improve crawlability.

- 🛠️ **Component structure and reusability**:
  - Create a shared components library for commonly used UI elements like buttons, modals, and loaders.

- ⚡ **Performance optimizations**:
  - Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.

- 🛑 **Error boundaries**:
  - Implement error boundaries to catch and display errors in critical parts of the app (e.g., product details, search results).
  - Create a reusable `ErrorBoundary` component to wrap around components prone to errors.

- ❌ **Proper error handling**:
  - Handle API errors gracefully by showing appropriate error messages (e.g., "Failed to load products").
  - Add fallback UI for cases where data cannot be fetched or rendered (e.g., "No products found").
